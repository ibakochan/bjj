This is the first site I ever made. It is a site for managing members of jiu jitsu gyms.
My jiu jitsu gym has a system where number of attended classes determines the number of stripes they have on their belt.
The problem was though that taking attendance for this took 10 min after every class since it was done with a paper form.
Making new papers every year appearantly took many hours as well.
This site reduced time needed after each class to about 30 seconds.

The main pages are:
The 2 schedules Kix and Iwade lesson lists and the profile page.

On the schedules you can:
Create new lessons, add members to the lessons and update lessons etc.
If you enter the lessons you can increase members attendance. The members will be ordered from most recent attendance to least recent. You can also see when they last participated.

On the profile page you can:
Manage information about students, such as belt color, number of stripes, participation count for each belt color and how many times theyve participated on this current month.
I could not use scheduled events though since I am using a free version of Pythonanywhere, so I made a reset button for everyones monthly counts that the trainer will need to push once a month to reset everyones mothly attendance count.
Members can also login to their account to check their current monthly attendance, this is so that members that are for example 5 days a month members can track how many times left they can attend on the current month.
